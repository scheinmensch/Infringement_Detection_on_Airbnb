# Infringement detection on Airbnb

We analyze the Airbnb listings of three European cities. We investigate to what extent the applicable laws are complied with and which patterns indicate that Airbnb is operated commercially and to a critical extent in a city. Based on our findings, we create a machine learning model that detects irregularities and classifies offers accordingly.

Data used in this project is taken from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data). Many thanks!

Some additional data is collected by a webscraper.
